# variable, is there a significant difference in treatment condition for acrylamide?

# normality assumptions.

boxplot(acrylamide1~treat,data=heights1, ylab="Blood cotinine level")


# the usual t-test assumes that the variances for each group are the same
# checking this now for acrylamide1
# testing for equal variance using Bartlett's test (homogeneity of variance assumption)

bartlett.test(acrylamide1~treat, heights1)

#   since the p-value for this test is > 0.05 (actually a lot greater), 
#   there is no evidence that the variances for the different treatments
#   are different.  Can proceed with the usual t-test

# equal variance assumption met
t.test(heights1$acrylamide1~heights1$treat,var.equal = TRUE) 

# what is the p-value? 0.4211
# there is no significant difference in acrylamide1 values, correct? Correct
