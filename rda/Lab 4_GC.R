# Biostatistics for Public Health
# George Cede√±o
# New York University

# Code revised by Prof. Amy Davidow
# September 24, 2021

# Notes: The following code is to conduct R procedures contained within the Biostatistics for Public Health lab.
# Only the code and associated datasets are provided. 

# Each week, the R code files will follow the same format. First, the overall code will be introduced in it's default form.
# After all the code is introduced, the lab will then have specific R code tailored to the code performed in each lab.


#Packages used, install using the following command:
install.packages("plyr") # Tools for splitting, applying, & combining data


# R is very flexible and powerful for subsetting using the dataframes. 
# Assuming we have an active data frame called mydata. The following command options are viable:
