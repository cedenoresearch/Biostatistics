# Notes: The following code is to conduct R procedures contained within the Biostatistics for 
# Public Health lab, which is taught using Stata. Only the code and associated datasets are provided. 
# No instruction in R is given nor any course support, however the R code is annotated such 
# that students can follow along. Using R is not a requirement of the course and is only for 
# interested students. Note that a '#' character indicates the proceeding text is a comment.

# Estriadol = 54.9462 + -0.4569(BMI)
# Interpretation: 
# One unit change in BMI translates to a decrease in estradiol by 0.4569. 
# If BMI were 0, estradiol level would be 54.9462.
# BMI variable is statistically sig & multiple r^2 is 0.00758, or .7%. 
# Meaning the predictor/explanatory variable of BMI explains ~.2% of the variance
# in the outcome of estradiol - poor model.

summary(estra.race)
# Estriadol = 38.121 + 16.986(race_2)
# Interpretation: 
# One unit change in race, from black to white, translates in an increase in estradiol by 16.986. 
# If race were 0, estradiol level would be 38.121. 
# Race variable is statistically sig & adj-r is 0.07332, or 7.3%. 
# Meaning the predictor/explanatory variable of race explains ~7% of the variance
# in the outcome of estradiol - not the best, but better than previous model.
